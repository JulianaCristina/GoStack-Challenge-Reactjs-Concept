	<h1>GoStack Bootcamp Challenge - ReactJS Concepts  </h1>
</div>

### About the challenge :rocket:
In this challenge, an application was created to train what I have learned so far in ReactJS!

Now you must continue to develop the application that will store your portfolio repositories, which you already developed the backend in the last challenge using Node.js.
<hr>

### Application features :rocket:

- List the repositories of the [API](https://github.com/JulianaCristina/GoStack-Challenge-Nodejs-Concept): Create a list with the title field of all the repositories that are registered in your API.

- Add a repository to your [API](https://github.com/JulianaCristina/GoStack-Challenge-Nodejs-Concept): Add a new item to your API via a button with the text Add and, after creation, you should be able to display its name after registration.

- Remove a repository from your [API](https://github.com/JulianaCristina/GoStack-Challenge-Nodejs-Concept): For each item on your list, you must have a button with the text Remove which, when clicked, will call a function to remove that item from the list of your frontend and your API.
